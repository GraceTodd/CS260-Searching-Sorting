          <h1 class="display-3">Searching And Sorting</h1>
          
          
          <h2>Searching</h2>
          <p>Searching is the slgorithmic process of finding a particular item in a collection of items.
          A search typically answers either TRUE or FALSE as to whether the item is present. On occasion
          it can be modified to return whether the item is FOUND.</p>
          <p>In Python, there is a simple way to ask whether an item is in a list of items: using the IN operator.</p>
          <p>>>> 15 in [3, 4, 2, 4, 1]</p>
          <p>False</p>
          <p> However, there are other, more explicitly stated functions that can be implemented into a Python 
          program specifically. For instance, the Sequential Search. </p>
          
          <h3>The Sequential Search</h3>
          <p>When data items are stored in a collection such as a list, we say that they have a linear or sequential 
          relationship. Each data item is stored in a position relative to the others. In Python lists, these relative positions are the index values
          of the individual items. Since these index values are ordered, it is possible for us to visit them in sequence.
          This process gives rise to our first searching technique, the sequential search.</p>
          <p>If the item is present within the list, the complexity of the sequential search is O(1) at best and O(n)
          at worst. If the item is not present, the complexity will only be O(n).</p>
          
          <iframe src="https://pastebin.com/embed_iframe/rubiunw5" style="border:none;width:100%;height:500px"></iframe>
          
          <p>Because the function orderedSequentialSearch searches an ordered list, we can use the other values in the list to 
          decide whether or not we have passed where the value should be. For instance, if we are searching for the value
          5 but our sequential search function has found the value 7, our function can postulate that the list does not
          hold a value of 5.</p>
          
          <h3>The Binary Search</h3>
          <p>It is possible to take greater advantage of the ordered list if we are clever with our comparisons.
          In the sequential search, when we compare against the first item, there are at most n - 1 more items 
          to look through if the first item is not what we are looking for. Instead of searching a list in 
          sequence, a BINARY SEARCH will start by examining the middle term. I fthat item is the one we are
          searching for, we are done. If it is not the correct item, we can use the ordered nature of the list 
          to eliminate half of the remaining items. If the item we are searching for is greater than the middle 
          item, we know that the entire lower half of the list as well as the middle item can be eliminated from 
          further consideration.</p>
          
          <p>One of the drawbacks of a binary search is that because it searches directly based on whether or not
          the selected term is greater than or less than the sought out item, it cannot be done on an unordered list.
          If we start with a sorted list of n items, about (n/2) items will be left after the first comparison. After
          the second comparison, there will be about (n/4), then (n/8), and so on. The maximum number of comparisons 
          is logarithmic with respect to the number of items in the list. Therefore teh binary search is O(log n).
          For this reason, it is important to note that for small values of n, the additional cost of sorting is
          probably not worth it, even though a binary search is generally better than a sequential search. Even for 
          large lists, however, sorting even once can be so expensive that simply performing a sequential search
          from the start may be the best choice. </p>
          
          <h3>Hashing</h3>
          <p>Hashing is a data structure that can be searched in O(1) time. In order to do this, we will need to 
            know even more about where the items might be when we go to look for them in the collection. If every 
            item is where it should be, then the search can use a single comparison to discover the presence of 
            an item. However, this is not typically the case. </p>
